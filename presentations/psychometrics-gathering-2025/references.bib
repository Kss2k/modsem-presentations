	abstract = {The (latest) crisis in confidence in social psychology has generated much heated discussion about the importance of replication, including how it should be carried out as well as interpreted by scholars in the field. For example, what does it mean if a replication attempt “fails”—does it mean that the original results, or the theory that predicted them, have been falsified? And how should “failed” replications affect our belief in the validity of the original research? In this paper, we consider the replication debate from a historical and philosophical perspective, and provide a conceptual analysis of both replication and falsification as they pertain to this important discussion. Along the way, we highlight the importance of auxiliary assumptions (for both testing theories and attempting replications), and introduce a Bayesian framework for assessing “failed” replications in terms of how they should affect our confidence in original findings.},

Research on Type D personality serves as a good case study for that matter. In Study 1, we fitted a multivariate interaction model to predict depression and anxiety with Type D personality, operationalized as an interaction between its two subcomponents negative affectivity (NA) and social inhibition (SI). We constructed this interaction according to four approaches: (1) sum score product; (2) single product indicator; (3) matched product indicators; and (4) latent moderated structural equations (LMS). In Study 2, we compared these interaction models in a simulation study by assessing for each method the bias and precision of the estimated interaction effect under varying conditions. In Study 1, all methods showed a significant Type D effect on both depression and anxiety, although this effect diminished after including the NA and SI quadratic effects. Study 2 showed that the LMS approach performed best with respect to minimizing bias and maximizing power, even when item scores were ordinal and skewed. However, when latent traits were skewed LMS resulted in more false-positive conclusions, while the Matched PI approach adequately controlled the false-positive rate.},

The proposed method for representing latent variable interactions has potential advantages over extant procedures. First, the latent variable interaction is derived from the observed covariation pattern among all possible indicators of the interaction. Second, no constraints on particular estimated parameters need to be placed. Third, no recalculations of parameters are required. Fourth, model estimates are stable and interpretable. In our view, the orthogonalizing approach is technically and conceptually straightforward, can be estimated using any structural equation modeling software package, and has direct practical interpretation of parameter estimates. Its behavior in terms of model fit and estimated standard errors is very reasonable, and it can be readily generalized to other types of latent variables where nonlinearity or collinearity are involved (e.g., powered variables).},

A key benefit of the orthogonalizing strategy is that it eliminated the need to estimate a mean structure as required by the mean-centering strategy, but required a potentially cumbersome 2-step estimation procedure. In contrast, the double-mean-centering strategy eliminates both the need for the mean structure and the cumbersome 2-stage estimation procedure. Furthermore, although the orthogonalizing and double-mean-centering strategies are equivalent when all indicators are normally distributed, the double-mean-centering strategy is superior when this normality assumption is violated. In summary, we recommend that applied researchers wanting to estimate latent interaction effects use the double-mean-centering strategy instead of either the single-mean-centering or orthogonalizing strategies, thus allowing them to ignore the cumbersome mean structure.},

	abstract = {Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, Ajzen, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability.},

A coding error in Figure 7 for Dishonoring Family appeared. The corrected Figure 7 now appears.] Social status is a central and universal feature of our highly social species. Reproductively relevant resources, including food, territory, mating opportunities, powerful coalitional alliances, and group-provided health care, flow to those high in status and trickle only slowly to those low in status. Despite its importance and centrality to human social group living, the scientific understanding of status contains a large gap in knowledge—the precise criteria by which individuals are accorded high or low status in the eyes of their group members. It is not known whether there exist universal status criteria, nor the degree to which status criteria vary across cultures. Also unknown is whether status criteria are sex differentiated, and the degree of cross-cultural variability and consistency of sex-differentiated status criteria. The current article investigates status criteria across 14 countries (N = 2,751). Results provide the first systematic documentation of potentially universal and sex-differentiated status criteria.

	abstract = {Chronic fatigue syndrome is an illness characterized by a profound, disabling, and unexplained sensation of fatigue lasting at least 6months, which severely impairs daily functioning and is accompanied by a combination of non-specific symptoms. Many potential causes of chronic fatigue syndrome have been investigated, including viral infections, immune dysfunctions, abnormal neuroendocrine responses, central nervous system abnormalities, autonomic dysfunctions, impaired exercise capacities, sleep disruptions, genetic backgrounds, psychiatric abnormalities, personality, and abnormal psychological processes. However, no etiology, specific physical signs or laboratory test abnormalities have been found. It is essential to establish a conceptual theory of chronic fatigue syndrome that can explain its pathophysiology in order to identify the clinical entity and to develop effective treatment methods. In this article, a new conceptual hypothesis about the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue syndrome, the co-conditioning theory, is presented: after repetitive overwork and/or stress, alarm signal to rest and fatigue sensation may cause in response to an unconditioned stimulus (impaired homeostasis and function) that has been paired with a conditioned stimulus (overwork and/or stress). In the future, a new treatment strategy for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, re-co-conditioning therapy, may be developed on the basis of the co-conditioning theory. In addition, this theory will likely contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue syndrome.},

	abstract = {Background Functional cognitive disorder (FCD) describes cognitive dysfunction in the absence of an organic cause. It is increasingly prevalent in healthcare settings yet its key neuropsychological features have not been reported in large patient cohorts. We hypothesised that cognitive profiles in fibromyalgia (FM), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and functional neurological disorders (FNDs) would provide a template for characterising FCD.
Methods We conducted a systematic review of studies with cognition-related outcomes in FM, CFS and FND.
Results We selected 52 studies on FM, 95 on CFS and 39 on FND. We found a general discordance between high rates of subjective cognitive symptoms, including forgetfulness, distractibility and word-finding difficulties, and inconsistent objective neuropsychological deficits. Objective deficits were reported, including poor selective and divided attention, slow information processing and vulnerability to distraction. In some studies, cognitive performance was inversely correlated with pain, exertion and fatigue. Performance validity testing demonstrated poor effort in only a minority of subjects, and patients with CFS showed a heightened perception of effort.
Discussion The cognitive profiles of FM, CFS and non-cognitive FND are similar to the proposed features of FCD, suggesting common mechanistic underpinnings. Similar findings have been reported in patients with mild traumatic brain injury and whiplash. We hypothesise that pain, fatigue and excessive interoceptive monitoring produce a decrease in externally directed attention. This increases susceptibility to distraction and slows information processing, interfering with cognitive function, in particular multitasking. Routine cognitive processes are experienced as unduly effortful. This may reflect a switch from an automatic to a less efficient controlled or explicit cognitive mode, a mechanism that has also been proposed for impaired motor control in FND. These experiences might then be overinterpreted due to memory perfectionism and heightened self-monitoring of cognitive performance.},

However, immune dysregulation with impaired NK cell dysfunction and tendency to novel autoimmunity have been frequently reported. These may contribute to reactivation of previous acquired viruses/retrovirusesaccompanied by impaired endocrine regulation and mitochondrial energy generation. The unpredictable nature of seemingly unconnected and diverse symptoms that are poorly responsive to several allopathic and alternative therapies then contributes to an escalation of the illness with secondary dysfunction of multiple other systems.

	abstract = {This study examined the relationship between EEG recordings of 28 females with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and age matched controls of the same gender. CFS subjects' EEG recordings were also compared to their responses on the Profile of Fatigue Related Symptoms, and two questionnaires developed specifically for this study. EEG electrodes were placed in a monopolar arrangement (active lead at CZ, ground lead in the center of the forehead, and two reference electrodes clipped to the earlobes) according to the international 10–20 system, and impedance was kept below 6 kohms. The data were collected under two conditions: eyes closed and serial sevens (while the subjects silently counted backward from 900 by seven). CFS EEG microvolt levels were significantly higher in the 5–7 Hz range in both conditions and were significantly lower in the 9–11 Hz range during the serial sevens task. In the eyes closed condition, peak alpha (the frequency between 8 to 13 Hz at which the greatest amount of energy was observed) correlated negatively with the “fatigue today” rating and the peak frequency (the frequency between 4 to 20 Hz at which the greatest amount of energy was observed) correlated negatively with the theta to beta ratio and the total fatigue score. During the serial sevens task, peak frequency correlated negatively with the total cognitive difficulty rating. No EEG differences were found between employed and non-employed CFS subjects nor between CFS subjects who were taking antidepressant medications versus those who were not. Subjective symptom ratings and EEG comparisons suggest that CFS symptomology is displayed physiologically in the EEG. Implications are discussed.},

We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis.

	abstract = {Interventions based on mindfulness meditation are increasingly common and evidence exists supporting their use. However, questions remain regarding treatment mechanisms accounting for beneficial effects. The current study examined 1 candidate mechanism—mindfulness practice quality—as a mediator of the link between practice time and outcome within mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR). Participants (n = 96) completed measures of mindfulness and psychological symptoms at baseline and posttreatment. A weekly questionnaire assessed practice time and quality over the 8 weeks of MBSR. Multilevel models accounted for nesting within participants, MBSR groups, and instructors. Results generally supported the reliability and validity of a weekly single-item practice quality measure. Greater practice time was associated with improved practice quality (r = .48). Increases in practice quality predicted improvements in self-report mindfulness and psychological symptoms (βs = .35, .30, and −.19, ps p = .879). In multilevel mediation models, improved practice quality mediated the link between practice time and changes in self-report mindfulness, suggesting improved practice quality functions as a mechanism linking practice time and outcome in MBSR. Future research evaluating practice quality in clinical samples, in tandem with intensive sampling paradigms (e.g., experience sampling) and objective (behavioral, physiological) outcomes may be warranted.

	abstract = {Objective 
          We tested a theoretical stress model cross-sectionally and prospectively that examined whether relationships of chronic stress, psychophysiology, and coronary heart disease (CHD) varied in older adult men (N = 47), older adult women not using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) (N = 64), and older adult women using HRT (N = 41).
          Method 
          Structural equations examined relationships of CHD with 1) chronic stress (caring for a spouse with Alzheimer’s disease and patient functioning), 2) vulnerability (anger and hostility), 3) social resources (supports), 4) psychological distress (burden, sleep problems, and low uplifts), 5) poor health habits (high-caloric, high-fat diet and limited exercise), and 6) the metabolic syndrome (MS) (blood pressure, obesity, insulin, glucose, and lipids).
          Results 
          Caregiver men had a greater prevalence of CHD (13/24) than did noncaregiver men (6/23) (p {\textless} .05) 27 to 30 months after study entry. This was influenced by pathways from caregiving to distress, distress to the MS, and the MS to CHD. In men, poor health habits predicted the MS 15 to 18 months later, and the MS predicted new CHD cases over 27 to 30 months. In women, no “caregiving-CHD” relationship occurred; however, 15 to 18 months after study entry women not using HRT showed “distress-MS” and “MS-CHD” relationships. In women using HRT, associations did not occur among distress, the MS, and CHD, but poor health habits and the MS were related.
          Conclusions 
          In older men, pathways occurred from chronic stress to distress to the metabolic syndrome, which in turn predicted CHD. Older women not using HRT showed fewer pathways than men; however, over time, distress, the MS, and CHD were related. No psychophysiological pathways occurred in older women using HRT.},

There is growing interest in moving away from unidirectional models of the stress-depression association, toward recognition of the effects of contexts and personal characteristics on the occurrence of stressors, and on the likelihood of progressive and dynamic relationships between stress and depression over time—including effects of childhood and lifetime stress exposure on later reactivity to stress.},

	abstract = {EEG microstate analysis offers a sparse characterisation of the spatio-temporal features of large-scale brain network activity. However, despite the concept of microstates is straight-forward and offers various quantifications of the EEG signal with a relatively clear neurophysiological interpretation, a few important aspects about the currently applied methods are not readily comprehensible. Here we aim to increase the transparency about the methods to facilitate widespread application and reproducibility of EEG microstate analysis by introducing a new EEGlab toolbox for Matlab. EEGlab and the Microstate toolbox are open source, allowing the user to keep track of all details in every analysis step. The toolbox is specifically designed to facilitate the development of new methods. While the toolbox can be controlled with a graphical user interface (GUI), making it easier for newcomers to take their first steps in exploring the possibilities of microstate analysis, the Matlab framework allows advanced users to create scripts to automatise analysis for multiple subjects to avoid tediously repeating steps for every subject. This manuscript provides an overview of the most commonly applied microstate methods as well as a tutorial consisting of a comprehensive walk-through of the analysis of a small, publicly available dataset.},

	abstract = {The present review discusses a well-established method for characterizing resting-state activity of the human brain using multichannel electroencephalography (EEG). This method involves the examination of electrical microstates in the brain, which are defined as successive short time periods during which the configuration of the scalp potential field remains semi-stable, suggesting quasi-simultaneity of activity among the nodes of large-scale networks. A few prototypic microstates, which occur in a repetitive sequence across time, can be reliably identified across participants. Researchers have proposed that these microstates represent the basic building blocks of the chain of spontaneous conscious mental processes, and that their occurrence and temporal dynamics determine the quality of mentation. Several studies have further demonstrated that disturbances of mental processes associated with neurological and psychiatric conditions manifest as changes in the temporal dynamics of specific microstates. Combined EEG-fMRI studies and EEG source imaging studies have indicated that EEG microstates are closely associated with resting-state networks as identified using fMRI. The scale-free properties of the time series of EEG microstates explain why similar networks can be observed at such different time scales. The present review will provide an overview of these EEG microstates, available methods for analysis, the functional interpretations of findings regarding these microstates, and their behavioral and clinical correlates.},

Our present study aims to determine whether there are differences in the secretion of salivary cortisol between palliative care unit health professionals with and without burnout, and to elucidate whether there is a relationship between burnout syndrome and perceived stress and psychopathological status in this population.Method:A total of 69 health professionals who met the inclusion criteria participated in our study, including physicians, nurses, and nursing assistants. Some 58 were women (M = 29.65 years, SD = 8.64) and 11 men (M = 35.67 years, SD = 11.90). The level of daily cortisol was registered in six measurements taken over the course of a workday. Burnout syndrome was evaluated with the Maslach Burnout Inventory–Human Services Survey (MBI–HSS), the level of perceived stress was measured using the Perceived Stress Scale, and psychopathological status was gauged using the SCL–90–R Symptoms Inventory.Results:There were statistically significant differences in secretion of cortisol in professionals with high scores on a single subscale of the MBI–HSS [F(3.5) = 2.48, p {\textless} 0.03]. This effect was observed 15–30 minutes after waking up (p {\textless} 0.01) and at bedtime (p {\textless} 0.06). Moreover, the professionals with burnout showed higher scores on the psychopathology and stress subscales than professionals without it.Significance of results:A higher score in any dimension of the burnout syndrome in palliative care unit health professionals seems to be related to several physiological and psychological parameters. These findings may be relevant for further development of our understanding of the relationship between levels of burnout and cortisol secretion in the health workers in these units.},

	abstract = {Background
There is no consensus about how resilience is related to the different types of stress such as daily or chronic stress and psychopathology. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between resilience and the different measures of stress such as perceived stress, chronic stress, life events, HPA axis response during a stressful task and psychopathology.
Material and methods
The design was cross-sectional. Resilience, perceived stress, stressful life events, hair cortisol and HPA axis response during Trier Social Stress Test measured by salivary cortisol samples and psychopathological symptoms were assessed in a sample of 80 University students.
Results
Participants with low resilience showed higher scores in perceived stress level (p {\textless} .001), the number of current life events (p {\textless} .02), the intensity of stressful events (p {\textless} .025) as well as Obsession and Compulsion (p = .006), Interpersonal Sensitivity (p = .028), Phobic Anxiety (p = .044) and psychopathological severity (p = .033). Resilience was associated with chronic stress by perceived stress (p {\textless} .001), hair cortisol concentration (p = .022), obsessions and compulsions (p = .016), interpersonal sensitivity (p = .022), and depression symptoms (p = .039).
Conclusion
Resilience seems to be determinant in perceived stress, the number of current life events, the intensity of stressful events, chronic stress, obsession and compulsions, interpersonal sensitivity, phobic anxiety and depression symptoms, and psychopathological severity index.},

	abstract = {Objective
The current study examined multiple stress indicators (chronic, perceived, traumatic) in relation to prevalent coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and major cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (i.e., diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, current smoking) in the multi-site Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) Sociocultural Ancillary Study (2010–2011).

Methods
Participants were 5313 men and women, 18–74 years old, representing diverse Hispanic/Latino ethnic backgrounds, who underwent a comprehensive baseline clinical exam and sociocultural exam with measures of stress.

Results
Chronic stress burden was related to a higher prevalence of CHD after adjusting for sociodemographic, behavioral and biological risk factors [OR (95\% CI) = 1.22, (1.10–1.36)] and related to stroke prevalence in the model adjusted for demographic and behavioral factors [OR (95\% CI) = 1.26, (1.03–1.55∂)]. Chronic stress was also related to a higher prevalence of diabetes [OR=1.20, (1.11–1.31)] and hypertension [OR=1.10 (1.02–1.19)] in individuals free from CVD (N=4926). Perceived stress [OR=1.03 (1.01–1.05)] and traumatic stress [OR=1.15 (1.05–1.26)] were associated with a higher prevalence of smoking. Participants who reported a greater number of lifetime traumatic events also unexpectedly showed a lower prevalence of diabetes [OR=.89 (.83–.97)] and hypertension [OR=.88 (.82–.93)]. Effects were largely consistent across age and sex groups.

Conclusions
The study underscores the utility of examining multiple indicators of stress in relation to health, since the direction and consistency of associations may vary across distinct stress conceptualizations. In addition, the study suggests that chronic stress is related to higher CVD risk and prevalence in Hispanics/Latinos, the largest U.S. ethnic minority group.},

	abstract = {Over the past several decades, stress research has experienced a broadening of its pathologic focus to encompass the concept of resilience. There is a wealth of research on resilience but no general consensus regarding its conceptualization. Some define resilience as attaining eventual favorable outcomes following exposure to adversity. Others define it as specific relatively short-term responses characterized by a return to homeostasis after initial disruption due to a stressor, and still others refer to resilience as resources that enable the individual to withstand or recover from major stressors. Many of the existing conceptualizations of resilience are not applicable in the context of chronic stress which is particularly harmful to health. How do adults who experience chronic stress survive, manage, and thrive, and what resources enable them to do so? In this paper, we consider these questions by reviewing traditions of research and definitions of resilience in order to inform an understanding of resilience in general, and for the study of chronic stress in adults. Based on a review of the literature, we developed a taxonomy of resilience resources that can be applied broadly, and guide future research.},

Responses of residents from a city and rural community in Southern Israel, both exposed to 7 years of daily mortar fire, were compared to residents from demographically, socio-economically and geographically comparable non-exposed control samples to examine protective factors and predictors of vulnerability to chronic war-related attacks. Samples from a highly exposed city (Sderot) and a highly exposed rural community region (Otef Aza), along with a demographically comparable comparison non-exposed city (Ofakim) and non-exposed rural community region (Hevel Lachish), were obtained in 2007 using Random Digit Dialing. In total, 740 individuals (81.8\% participation rate) were interviewed about trauma exposure, mental health, functioning and health care utilization. In the highly exposed city of Sderot, 97.8\% of residents had been in close proximity to falling rockets; in the highly exposed rural community region of Otef Aza, 95.5\% were similarly exposed. Despite exposure to chronic rocket attacks, residents of Otef Aza evidenced little symptomatology: only one person (1.5\%) reported symptoms consistent with probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and functioning levels did not differ from those of non-exposed communities. In contrast, posttraumatic stress (PTS), distress, functional impairment and health care utilization were substantially higher in the highly exposed city of Sderot than the other three communities. Lack of resources was associated with increased vulnerability among city residents; predictors of PTS across all samples included being female, older, directly exposed to rockets, history of trauma, suffering economic loss, and lacking social support. Increased community solidarity, sense of belonging and confidence in authorities may have served a protective function for residents of rural communities, despite the chronic attacks to which they were exposed.},

Examining survey data from 95,499 nurses, we found much higher job dissatisfaction and burnout among nurses who were directly caring for patients in hospitals and nursing homes than among nurses working in other jobs or settings, such as the pharmaceutical industry. Strikingly, nurses are particularly dissatisfied with their health benefits, which highlights the need for a benefits review to make nurses’ benefits more comparable to those of other white-collar employees. Patient satisfaction levels are lower in hospitals with more nurses who are dissatisfied or burned out—a finding that signals problems with quality of care.

Burnout was measured using validated instruments. Satisfaction with work-life balance was explored.Of 27 276 physicians who received an invitation to participate, 7288 (26.7\%) completed surveys. When assessed using the Maslach Burnout Inventory, 45.8\% of physicians reported at least 1 symptom of burnout. Substantial differences in burnout were observed by specialty, with the highest rates among physicians at the front line of care access (family medicine, general internal medicine, and emergency medicine). Compared with a probability-based sample of 3442 working US adults, physicians were more likely to have symptoms of burnout (37.9\% vs 27.8\%) and to be dissatisfied with work-life balance (40.2\% vs 23.2\%) (P \&lt; .001 for both). Highest level of education completed also related to burnout in a pooled multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex, relationship status, and hours worked per week. Compared with high school graduates, individuals with an MD or DO degree were at increased risk for burnout (odds ratio [OR], 1.36; P \&lt; .001), whereas individuals with a bachelor's degree (OR, 0.80; P = .048), master's degree (OR, 0.71; P = .01), or professional or doctoral degree other than an MD or DO degree (OR, 0.64; P = .04) were at lower risk for burnout.Burnout is more common among physicians than among other US workers.

Only 21 percent of the residents with relationship problems felt that their hospital work was being affected negatively. A multiple regression analysis showed that 10 variables accounted for 50 percent of the variance in predicting relationship stress. The results suggest that scheduling and structural changes in residencies are necessary in order to reduce stress among residents. Perhaps equally important is the finding that stress can be buffered by family relationships and social contact.

	abstract = {There is great interest in ensuring that health system resources are used effectively. Dictionary says efficacy, effectiveness and efficiency are synonymous. Curiously, it is in many scientific fields where there has been imposed an artificial interpretation of these terms. Efficacy, in the health care sector, is the capacity of a given intervention under ideal or controlled conditions. Effectiveness is the ability of an intervention to have a meaningful effect on patients in normal clinical conditions. Efficiency is doing things in the most economical way. Therefore, it would be more correct to define as strategic efficacy/effectiveness to the aptitude to produce an effect realized in ideal conditions and tactical efficacy/effectiveness to the same effect looked in ordinary circumstances. Efficiency would be kept in its current definition.},

UPRIGHT (Universal Preventive Resilience Intervention Globally implemented in schools to improve and promote mental Health for Teenagers) is a research and intervention program in the Basque Country (Spain), Trentino (Italy), Low Silesia (Poland), Denmark and Reykjavik (Iceland). UPRIGHT implemented a co-creation research process whose results, outcomes and policy implications are presented here. The co-creation had a mixed-methods participatory research design with nine specific objectives linked to paired strategies of inquiry for adolescents, families, teachers and school staff. The overarching objective was to generate a valid and feasible regional adaptation strategy for UPRIGHT intervention model. Participants answered surveys (n = 794) or attended 16 group sessions (n = 217). The results integrate quantitative and qualitative information to propose a regional adaptation strategy that prioritizes resilience skills, adolescents? concerns, and preferred methods for implementation across countries and in each school community. In conclusion, a whole-school resilience program must innovate, include and connect different actors, services and communities, and must incorporate new technologies and activities outside the classroom. A participatory co-creation process is an indispensable step to co-design locally relevant resilience interventions with the involvement of the whole-school community.},

	abstract = {A debate surrounding modularity?the notion that the mind may be exclusively composed of distinct systems or modules?has held philosophers and psychologists captive for nearly 40 years. Concern about this thesis?which has come to be known as the massive modularity debate?serves as the primary grounds for skepticism of evolutionary psychology?s claims about the mind. In this article we argue that the entirety of this debate, and the very notion of massive modularity itself, is ill-posed and confused. In particular, it is based on a confusion about the level of analysis (or reduction) at which one is approaching the mind. Here we provide a framework for clarifying at what level of analysis one is approaching the mind and explain how a systemic failure to distinguish between different levels of analysis has led to profound misunderstandings of not only evolutionary psychology but also of the entire cognitivist enterprise of approaching the mind at the level of the mechanism. We furthermore suggest that confusions between different levels of analysis are endemic throughout the psychological sciences?extending well beyond issues of modularity and evolutionary psychology. Therefore, researchers in all areas should take preventive measures to avoid this confusion in the future.},

If theoretical predictions are weak we should not rely on all or nothing hypothesis tests. Different inferential methods may be most suitable for different types of research questions. Whenever researchers use NHST they should justify its use, and publish pre-study power calculations and effect sizes, including negative findings. Hypothesis-testing studies should be pre-registered and optimally raw data published. The current statistics lite educational approach for students that has sustained the widespread, spurious use of NHST should be phased out.},

We present novel evidence that analyzing ordinal data as if they were metric can systematically lead to errors. We demonstrate false alarms (i.e., detecting an effect where none exists, Type I errors) and failures to detect effects (i.e., loss of power, Type II errors). We demonstrate systematic inversions of effects, for which treating ordinal data as metric indicates the opposite ordering of means than the true ordering of means. We show the same problems — false alarms, misses, and inversions — for interactions in factorial designs and for trend analyses in regression. We demonstrate that averaging across multiple ordinal measurements does not solve or even ameliorate these problems. A central contribution is a graphical explanation of how and when the misrepresentations occur. Moreover, we point out that there is no sure-fire way to detect these problems by treating the ordinal values as metric, and instead we advocate use of ordered-probit models (or similar) because they will better describe the data. Finally, although frequentist approaches to some ordered-probit models are available, we use Bayesian methods because of their flexibility in specifying models and their richness and accuracy in providing parameter estimates. An R script is provided for running an analysis that compares ordered-probit and metric models.},

Evidence is presented that the Jöreskog-Yang procedure for estimating the Kenny-Judd interaction model is subject to severe convergence problems when implemented in LISREL8.3 and means for the indicators of the latent exogenous variables are nonzero. An alternative procedure is presented that solves the convergence problem and provides consistent estimators of the parameters. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Structural equation modeling (SEM) remains a critical methodological technique for testing theoretical models. As in the first edition, the purpose of this volume remains to provide a user-friendly, applied, intermediate-level coverage of SEM. As before, the volume is divided into three parts, Foundations, Extensions, and Assumptions. The Foundations part consists of revisions of three chapters from the first edition, as well as an entirely new chapter. The chapter on equivalent models (Hershberger \& Marcoulides) reminds us that there are typically several equivalent best-fitting models. The next chapter is on reverse arrow dynamics (Kline) and deals with models that involve feedback loops and/or reciprocal relations (often a challenging issue for the modeler). This is followed by a new chapter on partial least squares (PLS) modeling (Rigdon). The final chapter in this section on power analysis (Hancock \& French) further develops this important component of statistical analysis. The second part on Extensions moves us beyond the basics and into more advanced structural models. The first chapter in this part (Thompson \& Green) considers between-group differences in the context of multiple sample models. This is followed by a new chapter on conditional process models (Hayes \& Preacher). The next chapter moves us into interaction and quadratic effects latent variable models (Marsh, Wen, Hau, \& Nagengast). These types of models continue to increase in popularity. Next we see a chapter on latent growth models (Hancock, Harring, \& Lawrence). The last chapter in this part is a new chapter on exploratory SEM (Morin, Marsh, \& Nagengast). Although exploratory factor analysis has existed for over a century, exploratory SEM is rather new to the field. The last part of the volume is on Assumptions. Although often overlooked, assumptions represent a critical component of any inferential technique. This part begins with a chapter on nonnormal and categorical data (Finney \& DiStefano). The next chapter considers missing data in the SEM context (Enders). Chapter 13 involves a discussion of multilevel modeling (Stapleton). This is followed by a new chapter on Bayesian SEM (Levy \& Choi). The final chapter in the volume is on Monte Carlo or simulation studies (Bandalos \& Leite). This is one of the most important techniques in all of statistics, as this is where we find out where our methods work well and where they begin to break down.

SEMM was proposed as a technique for the approximation of nonlinear latent variable relationships by finite mixtures of linear relationships (Bauer 2005, 2007; Bauer, Baldasaro, and Gottfredson 2012). In addition to this semiparametric approach to nonlinear latent variable modeling, there are numerous parametric nonlinear approaches for normally distributed variables (e.g., LMS in Mplus; Klein and Moosbrugger 2000). Recently, an additional semiparametric nonlinear structural equation mixture modeling (NSEMM) approach was proposed by Kelava, Nagengast, and Brandt (2014) that is capable of dealing with nonnormal predictors. In the nlsem package presented here, the SEMM, two distribution analytic (QML and LMS) and NSEMM approaches can be specified and estimated. We provide examples of how to use the package in the context of nonlinear latent variable modeling.},

This ability of PLS-SEM to directly estimate the importance weights for attributes as a whole, rather than for the attribute’s levels, and to compute determinant respondent-specific latent variable scores applicable to attributes, can more effectively model and distinguish between rational (i.e., optimizing) decisions and pragmatic (i.e., heuristic) ones, when parameter estimations for attributes as a whole are crucial to understanding choice decisions.},
